      <description>Since being here in Berkely, life has become busy and full. I can imagine after a day of classes and RA works, I&amp;rsquo;ll just have no time and energy left for my private business, and that&amp;rsquo;s definitely not &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo;. Being a potential researcher in cognitive science is hard but full of surprises and the kind of feeling that I want. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it is general, but everytime I got that feeling, I would be just like &amp;ldquo;fast recharged&amp;rdquo; and happy to accept everything imperfect in the world.</description>
