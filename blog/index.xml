      <description>Since being in (Charan&amp;rsquo;s lab)[http://dml.ucdavis.edu] in Davis, I started to get the true feeling of research. It is not about pure passion in &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m doing something special&amp;rdquo;, but more like &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m doing what attracts me&amp;rdquo;. To be honest, research could be hard and demanding, which probably means occupying tons of your time being stupid; nevertheless, I am still here and being satisfied. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had any chance to publish anything, but it has already hypnotized me.</description>

      <description> It is simply another type of serial dependence (Manassi, 2019).
 It is when I stare at you and you stare at your stuffs.
 It is when I listen to my favorite song and look at your smile.
 It is when we finish our daily ritual and haste to hang up.
 It is reciprocal support and understanding.

      <description>Statistical Learning Recently is obsess with statistical learning (SL), and think that SL is literally applicable in everyday life event. Since I just think of some for now (most of them just skipped my head and it&amp;rsquo;s truly amazing feeling!), I will list them here.
 Perfect pitch practice in infants Non-native speaker learning English (or any other foreign language) by representation instead of translational understanding Everything related to pattern separation &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;  This is an immature thought, but SL could be an essential key to solve many specific cognition problems in the way of learning.</description>

      <title>Some simple thoughts for myself</title>

      <description>Since being here in Berkely, life has become busy and full. I can imagine after a day of classes and RA works, I&amp;rsquo;ll just have no time and energy left for my private business, and that&amp;rsquo;s definitely not &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo;. Being a potential researcher in cognitive science is hard but full of surprises and the kind of feeling that I want. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it is general, but everytime I got that feeling, I would be just like &amp;ldquo;fast recharged&amp;rdquo; and happy to accept everything imperfect in the world.</description>
