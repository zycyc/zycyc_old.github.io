      <description>Statistical Learning Recently is obsess with statistical learning (SL), and think that SL is literally applicable in everyday life event. Since I just think of some for now (most of them just skipped my head and it&amp;rsquo;s truly amazing feeling!), I will list them here.

      <description>Since being here in Berkely, life has become busy and full. I can imagine after a day of classes and RA works, I&amp;rsquo;ll just have no time and energy left for my private business, and that&amp;rsquo;s definitely not &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo;. Being a potential researcher in cognitive science is hard but full of surprises and the kind of feeling that I want. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it is general, but everytime I got that feeling, I would be just like &amp;ldquo;fast recharged&amp;rdquo; and happy to accept everything imperfect in the world.</description>
